/*
What are CTEs? 
- Common table expression
- Very similar to subquery
- with <name of CTE> as (
    <query>
)
select *
from <name of CTE>
where ...;

Advantages of this over subquery
- more readable
- can be reused in the same query mutliple times

Note - performance for subquery and CTE should be the same
